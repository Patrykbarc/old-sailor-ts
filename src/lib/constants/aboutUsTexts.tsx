          Old Sailor is a barbershop that was born out of a love for nautical
          adventures and good grooming.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all started five years ago when our founder, a former sailor,
          decided to start his own nautical store. In the meantime, thanks to
          his skills acquired during months of sea voyages, he also started
          offering barbering services to his customers, who were looking for a
          place where they could take care of their hair and beards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Word quickly spread about the sailor who could not only sell you the
          best maritime equipment but also give you a perfect shave and trim.
          Over time, the nautical supply store evolved into a full-fledged
          barbershop, and Old Sailor became a place where men could take care of
          their appearance and relax during their visit. The transition was
          seamless; the walls of the shop still echoed with tales of the sea,
          decorated with ship models, nautical charts, and the scent of salt air
          mixed with premium shaving cream.
